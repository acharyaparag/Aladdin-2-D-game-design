Description:In this project we were supposed to build two sprites:a sprite for background and a sprite that will bounce around in display window and incorporate these two sprites into a C++ framework.

XML File changes:
The following new fields were added in game.xml:
<noOfOrbs>,<backFile>,<backSrcx>,<backSrcy>,<backWidth>,<backHeight>,<backLoc>,<backSpeed>,<backTransparency>,<captionTitle> and <captionY>

The Specs that I implemented are:
Two Sprites are created:a sprite for background and a sprite that will bounce in the display window
Sprites were drawn using Inkscape
The sprites that will bounce in the display window are stored in an STL vector,number of sprites can be changed by changing the <noOfOrbs> field in the XML file
The code is free of memory leaks and does not contain any errors
